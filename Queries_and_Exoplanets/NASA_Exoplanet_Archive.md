## NASA Exoplanet Archive

* A database is an organised collection of (usually structured) data. 

* The NASA Exoplanet Archive is an online astronomical exoplanet catalog and data service that collects and serves public data that support the search for and characterization of extra-solar planets (exoplanets) and their host stars.

* Launched in April 2018, TESS is surveying the sky for two years to find transiting exoplanets around the brightest stars near Earth.

* Right now it has 101,077,422 Light Curves.
