## Queries and Exoplanets

### Exoplanetary Systems

These are stars beyond our own solar system that are known to have planets orbiting them.

Life in Exoplanets are determined by their position to the star.

* If it's too close, the temperature would be hot and water will either boil or evaporate.
* If it's too far, it will be ice, like in dwarf planets.
* The region where the temperature is just right for sustainability of water is called as __*Goldilocks Zone*__.

### Databases

* The most famous early example for database was the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that was pioneered by Microsoft database's guru Jim Gray.

* The SGSS was one of the first large projects to release all of their data online, with a full schema describing the data sets, and customizable query boxes to allow users to run their own queries on the server. 

### Exoplanets

* Thanks particularly to Kepler, hundreds of new planets are being confirmed every year, with thousands more candidates being found. 

* In the early days, they all show that the exoplanetry populations were dominated by really massive companions.
Most of them were more massive than Jupiter, and only 15% were less massive than Neptune.

* Then Kepler came along, and showed that most planets are actually quite small. In fact, only 15% are larger than Neptune, and Earth-size planets are more common than we thought.

* The most common planets of all are so called Super-Earths or Mini-Neptunes. These are planets with no direct analogs in our own solar system.

* One thing is for sure, the gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter are comparatively rare. 

* But Kepler was built to spot the planets that are hard  to find. Specifically, it was designed to determine the number of Earth-like planets in the galaxy. Its great sensitivity has lead to the discovery of some pretty
exciting planetary systems such as Kepler 11, a six planet system. And Kepler 186, with five planets, smaller than one and a half Earths. One of these is particularly interesting, Kepler 186F is the most Earth like planet we've found so far. 


#### Working of Kepler

* Kepler looked for planets using the transit method.
When a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks out some of the light, and the telescope detects this brief decrease in brightness.

* However, the planet's orbital plane has to be aligned just right with the telescope's line of sight, for this to work. And assuming that exoplanets orbital axes are randomly distributed in space, then the geometric probability of a transit is only about half a percent. 

* Of the more than half a million stars in Kepler's field of view, around 150,000 were chosen for observation.
And Kepler observed all of these stars simultaneously. 

* When an exoplanet is found, the transit itself is used to characterize the planet. In particular, the transit depth tells you how large the planet is in relation to its host star. 

* But there's a problem, in that the sizes are only relative. An observed transit could be the signature of a big planet orbiting a big star, or small planet orbiting a small star. Either way, we'd observe the same signal. You have to know something about your star to constrain the radius of the planet. 

* To solve this, Kepler has an input catalog, containing information on hundreds of thousands of stars in the telescope's field of view. One of the catalog properties is stellar radius, which is then used to calculate the planetary radius for each detected exoplanet. And in this way, scientists are able to characterize the vast population of exoplanets being discovered.
