## Queries and Exoplanets

### Exoplanetary Systems

These are stars beyond our own solar system that are known to have planets orbiting them.

Life in Exoplanets are determined by their position to the star.
- If it's too close, the temperature would be hot and water will either boil or evaporate.
- If it's too far, it will be ice, like in dwarf planets.
- The region where the temperature is just right for sustainability of water is called as __*Goldilocks Zone*__.

### Databases

* The most famous early example for database was the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that was pioneered by Microsoft database's guru Jim Gray.

* The SGSS was one of the first large projects to release all of their
data online, with a full schema describing the data sets, and
customizable query boxes to allow users to run their own queries on the server.
