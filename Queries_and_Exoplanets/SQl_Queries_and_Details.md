## Details

* Querying a list of planets by size is useful, because the size of a planet's a good indicator of what its surface is like.

* A giant planet the size of Jupiter is likely to be gaseous. While planets smaller than Earth are almost certainly going to be rocky. 

* The interesting parameter space is the so-called _super Earth regime_. Our solar system doesn't contain any planets that are only just larger than Earth. And we don't know what they look like. Do they have deep global oceans Are they gaseous like Neptune? Or mostly rocky like a scaled up version of Venus?

* Isolating a sample of planets by their radius for followup study is one way that astronomers can advance this exciting field of extraplanetary science.
