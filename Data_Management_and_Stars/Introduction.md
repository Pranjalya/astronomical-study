## Data Management

#### Pros of Databases
- Databases can make data access more convenient and more efficient,
- More scientists want to share moderate size data sets with the rest of the community. 

### Life of Stars
- All the materials around us were made through nuclear synthesis in stars.
- When stars explode as supernovae they can outshine an entire galaxy, hundreds of millions of light years away.
- This offers one of the fundamental methods of measuring the distances to the farthest galaxies. 
- A similar technique involves the study of an ensemble of stars in a galaxy and measuring the brightness of the most luminous stars. 
- Since red giant stars reach the same maximum luminosity independent of the galaxy they're in, we can tell how far away that galaxy is. 
- But we don't need entire galaxies. In fact, we can bring our science closer to home and study the star clusters within the Milky Way.
- By studying the life cycles of stars, we learn how long certain types of stars live for. So their absence within a given cluster tells us the minimum age for that cluster.
