## Survey in Optical light
* Light from each part of the electromagnetic spectrum gives us insight into different physical processes that are going on in stars and galaxies.
* For example, optical light, at wavelengths of hundreds of nanometers, can show us where energy is being emitted by hot objects, like stars.
* In contrast, radio emission, at centimeter to meter wavelengths, occurs when, for example, electrons are accelerated in magnetic fields, and can show us when massive shocks are occurring in space.

## Galactic Nuclei
* Each little black blob in a large survey of sky at radio wavelengths, is a distant radio galaxy. 
* The radio emission you see is typically coming from jets and lobes emitted by the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. We call these active galactic nuclei.

## Cross-matching
* We want to know which of these active galactic nuclei are located in which of these optical galaxies, and which of these measured objects correspond to the same physical one.
* To combine this information together and, hence, build a more complete picture of the galaxy, we need to match the objects in the radio survey with the objects in the optical survey. The way we usually do this is to create a catalogue of objects from each survey, and then do a positional cross-match.


- We know that supermassive black holes play a central role in regulating star formation, but how they do it is a major unanswered question. To investigate questions like this, we need to combine optical and radio information together.
