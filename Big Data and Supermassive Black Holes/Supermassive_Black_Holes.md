## Galaxy Structure and AGN
* Our eyes can only detect light and the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
* Galaxies are not just made up of stars, they also contain a lot of gas and dust, and at the heart of all large galaxies, a supermassive black hole, millions or even billions of times the mass of our sun, squeezed down into a space smaller than our solar system.
* In cases where there is a lot of gas in the central region of the galaxy, this material can be accreted on to the black hole via an Accretion Disk, releasing a lot of energy in the process.
* This is what we call, an Active Galactic Nucleus, or AGN. The radiation produced by the AGN is so bright that it can outshine the entire galaxy, producing far more energy than all of the galaxy's stars combined.
* The accretion process can also form huge jets of strong magnetic fields emanating out from around the black hole. And fast moving electrons spiraling around these magnetic fields, produce huge quantities of radio emissions.
* These radio jets can grow to enormous sizes, sometimes extending far beyond the galaxy to be millions of light-years across. They can also provide information on the past activity of the central black hole. Different epochs of accretion activity are marked out in the structure of the radio jets.
* However, not all galaxies have AGN and not all AGN produce radio jets. In fact, only about 10% of active galactic nuclei produce radio jets.


## Electromagnetic Spectrum
* The radiation from the Accretion Disc is brightest at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths.
* Infrared radiation comes from the dusty regions that surround the black hole.
* To fully understand the physics at play in these galaxies, we need to piece all this information together to get the complete picture of AGN.
