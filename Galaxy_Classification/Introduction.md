## Galaxy Classification

* The idea that island universe existed as well set foot to our own Milky Way had intrigued philosophers. The new telescopes of the late 19th and early 20th century made it possible to start observing these fuzzing nebulae in more detail. 

* At the time the term nebula was use to refer to all objects that appeared fuzzy and defused, in other words, not stars. Some of these nebulae were in fact star clusters in our own galaxy, whereas others with distant galaxy separate to our own. For the rest of the module, we'll refer to the these as galaxies to avoid confusion with what we now called nebulae. Clouds of gas and dust in our own galaxy like the famous Horsehead Nebula shown here. 

* Hubble's book, The Realm of the Nebulae, had a number of fascinating insights, not just about astronomy, but also about scientific methodology and the process of classification.

### Stellar Classification

* The process of classification involves sorting through the photographs, identifying key features of each galaxy. The more conspicuous examples of each type where then used as what we now call archetypes of each class. And the other galaxies were compared to them in order to classify them.

* Hubble used this approach to classify hundreds of galaxies. And in the process, developed one of the most famous classifications schemes in astronomy. The Hubble Sequence or the Hubble tuning fork diagram.

* In this scheme, Hubble described the visual properties of galaxies, their morphology or shape, ranging from regular, elliptical, and spiral shaped galaxies, to what appeared to be irregular collections of stars and gas.

* Hubble's scheme has been widely used and widely reinterpreted and misinterpreted. But the underlying morphological descriptions still stand today as a useful way of describing galaxies. 

* These morphological classifications turn out to be correlated with important physical properties of galaxies. Such as their star formation rate, which helps us understand galaxy formation and evolution.
