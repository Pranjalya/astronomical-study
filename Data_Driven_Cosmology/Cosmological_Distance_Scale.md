## Calculating Stellar Distance

* __Stage 1__ : The first and most direct method is called _parallax_. 
    - Hold your thumb out at arms length and look at it through only your right eye, now switch to your left eye. Your thumb appears to move relative to whatever it is in the background behind it.
    - Similarly, we can look at the nights sky and map the apparent positions of stars. We then shift our perspective by waiting for the Earth to go around the Sun. In six months, it will be around the other side.
    - Now, the closer a star is to Earth, the more it's position will appear to move against the background of more distant stars. And we can use how much the star shift to measure their distance.
    - But this only works for nearby stars. If the star is too far away, then the shift in position will be too small to measure. But we can measure far enough away to make it our next step. 

* __Stage 2__ : The second stage needs a type of star known as a _Cepheid variable_.
    - These stars change their brightness at a very regular rate and we discovered something very useful. The period of the brightness variation tells us how intrinsically bright the star is. The brighter the star, the longer the period.
    - We can compare how brighter Cepheid variable star looks from Earth with its intrinsic brightness that we deduce from its period and work out how far away it actually is. 
    - And we can make sure we're doing it right by checking our answer for nearby Cepheid variable stars against the distance we get using the parallax method.
    - The advantages that because Cepheid variable styles are very bright, we can use them to see much further away, we can measure the distance to the nearby galaxies. 

* __Stage 3__ : The third stage uses an _explosion_.
    - When a very compact, almost burned out star known as a White Dwarf has a sudden influx of new material fall into it, it can suddenly reignite and explode. The great thing about this explosion for our purposes of at least is that they both very bright and very similar. 
    - So, if we see one of this type I (a) supernova, we can work out how bright it is intrinsically and so work out how far away it is.
    - And as before, we can check our answer whenever we see a type I (a) supernova in the same galaxy and so it roughly the same distance as a Cepheid variable star.
    - With type I (a) supernova, we can map out the universe. And using them, we've discovered another way of inferring distance, one that tells us something really interesting about the universe as a whole. 

* __Red Shift__ : Now we all know that hot things glow but when we zap some hydrogen gas with electricity and heat, it glows at a very specific set of colors, that is with light of really specific wavelengths.
    - In fact, each element in the periodic table, helium, carbon, oxygen, magnesium, all of them have a unique signature of wavelengths.
    - And we can see their signature in the Universe. We know what the Sun is made of because we see the signature of its elements in sunlight. 
    - And sometimes, we see a familiar signature but it's all shifted to longer or shorter wavelengths. It's hydrogen all right, but all of the wavelengths might be 10% longer than we measure in the laboratory.
    - Because red light has longer wave lengths than blue light, we call this kind of shifting of the wavelengths, red-shift or blue-shift. 
    - Well, the interesting thing is, for almost every galaxy in our universe, its light is red-shifted. We see the wavelength signatures of the elements and their stretched. We almost never see them compressed or blue-shifted. 
    - And thanks to type I (a) supernova, we know something else. To further away a galaxy is, the more it's light is red shifted. 
    - If a certain galaxy is red-shifted by 10%, a galaxy twice as far away will be red shifted by 20%, and one three times as far away by 30% and so on, this is known as _Hubble's law_.

* __Hubble's Law__ : Well, here's an arrangement of the universe that could explain Hubble's law. What if the universe is expanding? Think of the surface of a balloon as it's being blown up. If there are ants on the surface, they will all move away from each other. Even though none of them is actually at the center, the surface of the balloon doesn't have a center. 
    - And like the rubber of the balloon throughout the universe, space itself is expanding. As light travels from distant galaxies, we can think of its wavelength as stretching with the expanding space. So the further light has to travel, the more it will be stretched along the way, in other words, Hubble's law. 
    - Hubble's law is extremely useful, because measuring redshift is relatively easy and certainly much easier than hoping for a timely supernova.
    - For example, we can measure the wavelengths of light from a distant galaxy and look for the signatures of the elements.
    - Or, we can look at the relative amount of light in broad bands rather than individual wavelengths.
    - We can look at infrared light or red light, green light, blue light, near ultraviolet light, mid-ultraviolet light, and so on.
    - And we can compare this to standard libraries of galaxies and look for the redshift that gives the best match.
    - And once we've got a match, we can measure the redshift, and, thanks to Hubble's law, map out the galaxies of the cosmos.
