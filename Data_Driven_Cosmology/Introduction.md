## Data Driven Cosmology

### Classification Systems

* One of the most fascinating stories is that of Annie Jump Cannon and the classification of stellar spectra. In the late 1800s, Edward Pickering, the director of Harvard College Observatory, embarked on a survey of the whole sky using the relatively new technique of stellar spectroscopy. 

* Over several decades, a team of human computers worked on classifying the stars into different types, based on the presence of hydrogen, helium and other absorption lines in their spectra. 

* During this time, they developed and
experimented with a range of different classification schemes, before converging on the familiar OBAFGKM scheme we still use today. 

* Annie Jump Cannon was an extremely productive classifier.
Between 1911 and 1915, she classified 5,000 stars a month, resulting in an incredible set of over 200,000 stars that eventually formed the Henry Draper catalogue. 

### Importance of Classification

1. Classification based purely on observational properties of stars and galaxies is an empirical result that can survive regardless of changes in the theoretical interpretations.

2. The amount of information we need to process if we treat each star or galaxy from a large survey as an individual is so overwhelming as to be nearly useless.
Classification allows us to draw meaningful conclusions from data by abstracting it into categories. 

3. Classification can lead to a deeper physical understanding of the data. 

* In the case of Annie Cannon, the insight she developed from classifying so many stars led her and the team to develop a new classification system.

* Later, another astronomer Cecilia demonstrated that this scheme reflected a key physical property of stars, their surface temperature.

* In astronomy, machine learning has been used to classify stars and galaxies, identify volcanos on the surface of Venus, discover pulsars in massive high-resolution data sets, and many other applications.
